![KaeK’s no nonsense approach to off-road cycling required it to do something unique in the cyclocross market if it wanted to make an impact. Cutting through all of the faff and “standards” that are clogging up the sport with a uniquely adaptable CX frame was the answer.](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/d9a5bfe60ba2358f6913a55d8724ef9de4da5706.jpg)
![KaeK’s Pulp is a frame that can adapt to a wide variety of flavours (Single speed, geared, disc, 130mm, 135mm, 142mm, 148mm, Rolholf….etc) so that no matter what components you have you can always find a mount & dropout solution to build it up exactly how YOU want it. Nippy single speed 650b hardtail, you got it! Gnarly 148x12mm thru axle Cyclocross, no problem! Everybody rides a bike differently and for different reasons. By allowing crazy combinations of components on frames without the need for compromise (i’m looking at you, overpriced conversion kits) we give people the confidence try new things and maybe discover a way of cycling.](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/d8c5e8d307c27978cea6fb4545e7378d86350a51.jpg)
