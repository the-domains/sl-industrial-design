I've helped a range of clients from Seiko Epson Corporation & TAG Heuer to Early stage startups. Working with their design, branding and marketing teams to define, design and launch their new products.

In this day and age it is imperative that the physical design of a product be developed in step with the brand narrative and marketing strategy that will be used to launch it. Such coherent products have a far greater sense of purpose and are far more likely to be successful in the most competitive of markets.
